                    <p>Trying out microdosing psychoactive mushrooms. I think the dose I took was just a little bit too high, but no harm done. Me and David took the bus downtown. His car broke so he needs to ride the bus and he hasn't done that here before. Got some ramen with a friend. Was real cool... they're real cool. I definitely feel much better today than I have the past few days. :3</p>

                    <p>As it turns out, the CSS I was trying to put on the footer images on the site don't actually work on FireFox... I guess I'll be using Chrome now... I hope you're using chrome too I guess lol. Shout out to Herman too. He's soft and nice to pet I think. I have to work in a little bit... closing... I TOLD THEM IF THEY MADE ME CLOSE I WOULD QUIT AND THEN IMMEDIATELY GOT A FULL WEEK OF CLOSING SHIFTS???? BSSS!!!!!</p>
