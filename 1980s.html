                <h3>Episode 3: The Naked Now (1987)</h3>
                <img src="images/1980s/nakedNow.png" alt="Star Trek TNG episode 3">
                <p>In this episode, the Enterprise is investigating a research vessel that had a strange last transmission and lost contact with them. Hijinks insue. The entire crew gets infected with a disease and Wesley takes over control of the ship. Data gets... lets say... freaky with it. Data getting some gives me hope for myself. Good episode, interesting premise. Data pretending to be drunk is very silly. 8/10.</p><br>

                <p>The Burbs is about what life in the suburbs is really like. It's really like this. That's all. I enjoyed this movie, a fun watch. As someone who grew up in the suburbs, it really kind of did feel like this at times. Good performances from all the actors and I love to see Corey Feldman in things. 6/10.</p>
